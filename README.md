## Project: WeHeal
* This project aims to support the counselors to better focus on supporting mental healthcare patients.
* This is in no way a replacement to the counselors, rather, it helps them focus less on insignificant tasks and focus more on critical tasks.
* The AI agent are live during counselling sessions, and help the counselor with the following:
    * Summarize the general state and problems faced by the patient, in response to the pre-session questionaire document filled by the user.
    * Assist the counselor with replies based on user chat and context.
